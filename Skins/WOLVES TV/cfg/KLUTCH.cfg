// [Info=Copenhagen Wolves is a Danish based electronic sports club, which features some of the biggest stars that Denmark has to offer in various genres of competitive computer gaming. Our players are much more than just guys playing a game together for fun, they compete in major transnational tournaments and travel the continent to showcase their hard earned skills. We pride ourselves in our dedication and work ethic that has earned us the love and respect of our ever-growing fan base. Copenhagen Wolves was founded upon a common belief that electronic sports had far from reached its potential despite already being a billion dollar industry. In order to make a difference in a vast market, a new and alternative approach had to be taken. After a few weeks of evaluating and strategic planning the project now known as Copenhagen Wolves was ready to be revealed to the world. The main thing we wished the project to maintain was continuity, a quality severely lacking in the electronic sports world. In order to maintain this we needed to make clear-cut guidelines for the growth and execution of strategies and set a series of values that we believe have to be a part of everything we do.]
